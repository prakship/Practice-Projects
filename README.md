#### 1. Beginner mini-projects - This consists of beginner level analysis of datasets which include the following problems :

(a) Iris classification

Note : Will be adding more projects soon. I am still building my portfolio and will be gradually uploading mini-projects as I complete them in a structured manner. My plan is to start with beginner level projects then move on to more complicated ones. This repository will have three main folders :

1. Beginner mini-projects

2. Intermediate mini-projects

3. Advanced mini-projects

I have planned my schedule such that I will be adding atleast 5 mini-projects per folder by the end of February 2020. I believe that this kind of structured learning will help me gradually gain confidence in tackling real-world problems in a much more efficient manner.
