#### 1. Beginner mini-projects - This consists of beginner level analysis of datasets which include the following problems :

(a) Iris classification

Note : Will be adding more projects soon. I am still building my portfolio and will be gradually uploading mini-projects as I complete them in a structured manner. My plan is to start with beginner level projects then move on to more complicated ones. This repository will have three main folders :

1. Beginner mini-projects

2. Intermediate mini-projects

3. Advanced mini-projects

I have planned my schedule such that I will be adding atleast 5 mini-projects per folder by the end of February 2020. I believe that this kind of structured learning will help me gradually gain confidence in tackling real-world problems in a much more efficient manner. 


#### NOTE - General description of my workflow - Each project execution follows the steps mentioned below:

(a) Data pre-processing for converting data into a format executable for visualization or model fitting.

(b) Carry out Exploratory data analysis and try to get useful insights from the dataset visually. 

(c) Come up with research questions that could be probably solved by machine learning techniques.

(d) Next is training the model and it varies for each project and will be explained in each project separately.

(e) Testing the accuracy of the model and come up with better suggestions to improve the accuracy.
