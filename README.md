# Practice-Projects
## General description of my workflow
Each project execution follows the steps mentioned below:
1. Data pre-processing for converting data into a format executable for visualization or model fitting.
2. Carry out Exploratory data analysis and try to get useful insights from the dataset visually. 
3. Come up with research questions that could be probably solved by machine learning techniques.
4. Next is training the model and it varies for each project and will be explained in each project separately.
5. Testing the accuracy of the model and come up with better suggestions to improve the accuracy.
