## The following datasets have been analyzed while solving the corresponding question. Also, the results have been discussed for each research question :

### 1. Iris dataset 

#### How accurately can we classify the different species of Iris flowers given the dataset with following description:
(a) The Iris dataset has 150 records

(b) The features of the flowers are : Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal length, Petal width

(c) We have the target variable which is the Species of the Iris flower classified into 3 classes :

  1. 0 --- Setosa

  2. 1 --- Versicolor
  
  3. 2 --- Virginica

#### RESULTS :

(a) Four models 1. Logistic regression, 2. Random forest classifier, 3. Support Vector Machine and 4. K-Nearest Neighbours were implemented.

(b) Logistic Regression is our baseline model which gives an accuracy of 88.88%. 

(c)Support Vector Machine performs the best with an accuracy of 100% followed by Random forest and KNN who both give an accuracy of 97%.
